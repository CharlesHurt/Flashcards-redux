  Sweet alert to add q/a?

  MVP:
Full CRUD on some kind of data.
Have a list view where you can see all of your data in some kind of listed
format.  This may only show limited fields of the data.
Be able to select an item from the list to be able to see a detail view.
While in this view, the list goes away, and you see all of the detailed
information about the item.
The updating and deleting functions must be accessed through the detail view.
You must have confirmation on updating and deleting.  You must somehow implement
Sweet Alert.  (also check out ngSweetAlert for an easy way to trigger these
alerts in Angular.)
Your data must have an image component.  (your users can add an image url to
the new item, and that url can be put into an image tag using ng-src)
Extra Features:
Search filtering, and sorting with orderBy.
Investigate Angular UI-Router to organize and configure your different views.
Depending on what your data is, you can have all kinds of different extra
features.  Be creative!
Submission:
Commit and push to Github, and deploy to Heroku.  Then enter those into the
standard submission form.
